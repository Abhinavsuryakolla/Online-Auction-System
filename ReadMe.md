It supports live and upcoming auctions, secure payment processing, and a global network with local relevance. The platform emphasizes user trust through transparent policies and a modern UI/UX, differentiating it from competitors like eBay or Webtron.

Modern UI/UX: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS, featuring gradients, animations, and minimal gaps between auction cards for a sleek experience.
Secure Transactions: Military-grade encryption and third-party payment integration ensure safe bidding and purchasing.
Global Reach with Local Focus: Connects users from over 50 countries while supporting local item availability for inspection and authenticity.
Comprehensive Support: 24/7 support via email, phone, and a contact form, with social media integration for community engagement.
Scalable Architecture: Built with React and Axios for efficient data fetching, supporting concurrent users and future enhancements.

Installation
To set up Nexora locally, follow these steps:
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher)
npm or yarn
A running backend server (e.g., Node.js/Express) at http://localhost:5000 with an /api/auctions endpoint.

Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexora.git
cd nexora


Install Dependencies:
npm install

or
yarn install


Set Up Tailwind CSS:Ensure Tailwind CSS is configured. Create a tailwind.config.js file:
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'dark-blue': '#1E3A8A',
        'light-blue': '#0891B2',
        'cyan-600': '#0891B2',
        'cyan-900': '#0E7490',
      },
    },
  },
};

Add Tailwind to your index.css:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap');
body { font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; }

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(20px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
.animate-fadeIn {
  animation: fadeIn 1s ease-out forwards;
}


Configure Backend:Ensure your backend server is running and exposes the /api/auctions endpoint with auction data (including _id, startTime, and endTime fields).

Run the Development Server:
npm start

or
yarn start

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.


Usage

Homepage: Access the main page to view the Hero section, Featured Auctions (live and upcoming), Why Nexora, About, Policies, Contact, and Footer.
Bidding: Authenticated users can browse auctions and place bids (requires backend integration for bid submission).
Contact: Use the contact form or provided email/phone for support queries.
Navigation: Use the navbar (assumed to be in App.jsx) to access Auctions, About, Contact, and policy pages.
